                    <h3>What is Zenspot?</h3>
                    <p>Our organization Zenspot was founded in 2001 after a group of us who practice yoga together went on vacation. We figured out the perfect cocktail of fun and relaxation. Zenspot has grown to be a huge organization full of fun and loving people. <br> The team has picked each and every location, with having been there and experienced it themselves so we could make each experience unforgettable. Our included locations are all over the world and there's something for everyone! <br> Each Vacation includes Luxury stays, food & drinks, excursions and yoga classes.</p>
